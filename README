This project want realize a custom signal generator in QT with some function imported with matlab.
This sw in the very early stage and it's more a test than a useful app.

TODO:
- Export file in .wav (and may be flac??) formats?
- Saving project and re-open project
- FFT representation of the digest signal in real time
- Envelope function for any signal
- Improve widget signal option layout
- Add splitter on the main window 
- Improve zoom and pointer information (QWT)
- Multiplatform test
- FIX for mac framework/library install 
- Play digest curve

DOCS:
- Documentation of the working principle
- Guide to build your own signal function
- Complete function documentation

WISHES:
- Calculation of the crest factor
- Import .wav signal (and may be flac?)
- Resample of .wav signal
