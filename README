This project want realize a custom signal generator in QT with some function imported with matlab.
This sw in the very early stage and it's more a test than a useful app.

TODO:
- Saving project and re-open project, ON THE WAY
- FFT representation of the digest signal in real time
- Improve zoom and pointer information (QWT) 
- ReDefine style UI
- Multiplatform test
- FIX for mac framework/library install 

DOCS:
- Documentation of the working principle
- Guide to build your own signal function
- Complete functions documentation

WISHES:
- Calculation of the crest factor
- Save window options at quit
- differentiate curve file and project file, with suffix and with discrimination in the document type
- add menu
- add curves copy&paste
- Keyboard tool selection for zoom,panner and streaming position
- Import .wav signal (and may be flac?)
- Resample of .wav signal


BUG:

_ DomHelper::selfObjectData design should be improved
- save project has some problem in export.
- some graph waste in the first part of the graph. It's not reproduced looks waste of the qwt curve
- Name doesn't change in the toolbox widget when importing curve
- Remove curves, works only with one curves at time but the window allos to remove multiple cruves.
- Moving the stream position during play produce audio artefacts
- Changing project samplerate doesn't affect reproduction, there's an ASSERT and crash if SR!=48k, only 48 kHz are allowed
