This project want realize a custom signal generator in QT (it starts more than a game than a real app, but it works!)
This sw in an early stage and it needs more test. For now is tested only with a MacOSX but it should works with any other implementation
For now is tested only with a MacOSX but it should works with any other implementation but this needs manual  modification of  the .pro files.


FEATURE:
- Create your own test signal (tone, noise, square waves etc) and the framework manage in time with 3 approaches:
		- Continuos (the whole duration of the project)
		- Partial (for part of the duration of the project)
		- Repeated (a single part is repeated for the whole project).
Other nice features are:
- save/open project
- save/open curve
- export audio format (wav & flac)
- Tools for time/frequency handling
- Create complex project with multiple signals
- Display your curve with zoom pan etc (many widgets are based on QWT 6)
- Create wav and flac files from your project
- Display the stft of your signal


TODO:
- Improve zoom and pointer information (QWT) 
- ReDefine style UI
- Multiplatform test
- FIX for mac framework/library install  (now you need to copy by yourself the dylib)


DOCS (TODO):
- Complete documentation of the working principle
- Guide to build your own signal function
- Complete functions documentation

WISHES:
- Calculation of the crest factor
- Save window options at quit
- Keyboard tool selection for zoom,panner and streaming position
- Import .wav signal (and may be flac?)
- Resample of .wav signal
- Dynamic allocation and not pre-allocation to improve performance and memory footprint
- Plugin structure for envelope
- Use a generic audio signal as envelope (thanks Andrea for the suggestion!)

BUG:
- Moving the stream position during play produce audio artefacts
- Changing project samplerate doesn't affect reproduction, there's an ASSERT and crash if SR!=48k, only 48 kHz are allowed for now
